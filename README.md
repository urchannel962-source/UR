### License & Permissions
- This project is provided under the **MIT License** (see LICENSE file). That grants you broad permission to use, modify, distribute, and deploy the app.
- I cannot transfer legal ownership of external services or deployments (for example Vercel account, GitHub repo you don't control). To fully own a deployed instance, deploy from your GitHub/Vercel account. The MIT license gives you full rights to the code itself.

### Next steps to make it yours
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the project â€” you will own that repo.
2. Deploy to Vercel (connect your GitHub) or another host using your account.
3. Update `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` to a secure value and rotate any secrets.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Create a ready-to-deploy GitHub repo structure and instructions.
- Help with step-by-step deployment to your Vercel account.
